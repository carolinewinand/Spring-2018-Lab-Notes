Met with Dr. Stapleton to talk about my progjects for the beginning of 
this semester. We decided to work with the lessons on Data Carpentry. 
First mission was to download the files and play around with the file 
types. I went into the Genomics lessons and downloaded the two files 
that were sequences. (ARE THESE THE CORRECT FILES?) 

I downloaded a newer version of JAVA
I set my lab schedule
