I am trying to work on the connectivity problems with PuTTY, but I am 
still having issues gaining access to my account. My problem is strictly 
password based I believe. I logged onto the Atmopshere and Discovery 
Environment portals without issues. I am not able to chat through the 
help icon in the bottom right corner of the screen. I sent Jason this 
email before finishing my work for the day:


Jason,

I used the link that you sent to read up on PuTTY. I am not having 
connectivity issues anymore, but the program is not granting me access 
to my instance. I successfully enter the I.P address, and enter my 
username "carolinewinand" but when it prompts me for my password and I 
enter it, I am denied access. I tried to use the chat feature on the 
CyVerse website but it wasn't able to load. I think that this is an 
issue with my login information, because when I tried to submit a help 
ticket in JIRA I encountered a similar issue and wasn't able to login 
using my CyVerse credentials.
