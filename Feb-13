I emailed Jason about my problems with the PuTTY program. Here is a copy 
of that email:

Jason,


I apologize for the late response. I have been working on launching an 
instance with Atmosphere because I already have an account, and I 
figured I could offer some feedback for Cyverse because this platform is 
still in beta testing. 


I've hit a road block working with PuTTY. I have the program downloaded, 
I open it and paste in my Atmosphere IP address, and I am prompted to 
login. When I try to enter my password I get a few different kinds of 
error messages:


Connection Timed Out
Invalid Login
Access Denied
Fatal Error: Server Unexpectedly Closed Network Connection
Software Caused Connection Abort

The most common error was the Access Denied message. I reset my 
password, retried the program, and still could not successfully login. I 
am hoping you could offer me some advice for moving past this issue. 
Thank you for your consideration, I look forward to hearing from you at 
your earliest convenience.
