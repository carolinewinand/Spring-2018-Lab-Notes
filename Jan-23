A. I applied for an Atmosphere acocunt on Thursday afternoon right 
before leaving the lab. I was granted access on Friday afternoon. 
B. My job for today: 

	"Let’s post a message to Jason Williams after you’ve figured out 
how to get into their beta Atmosphere image."

C. Accomplished Today:
	1. Launched instance in Atmosphere
	2. Everything was moving in slow motion today because the wifi 
	was dreadful 
		a. could not connect PuTTY to the IP address on my 
		Atmosphere instance 
		because the wifi was so terrible. I got a 
		Network Error: connection timed about
		notice 4 times before restarting my computer to 
		see if that would help the connection
