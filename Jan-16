Found that I can drag files onto GitHub website to push them. Commit 
them in Bash then drag the file from explorer. Still need to figure out 
how I can write and push from the desktop app. 

nano file_name
git add
git commit -m "then add notes about file you created"

Questions answered during Genomics Lesson of Data Carpentry:

"What is the distribution of genome sizes for all the strains?
Is there a relationship between genome size and Cit status?
How many base pair changes are there between the Cit+ and Cit- strains?
What are the base pair changes between strains?"
