Jason Williams responded to my email about my issues:


Hi Caroline,

Here is some useful documentation, you should have no problem 
connecting: 
https://cyverse-atmosphere-guide.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/latest/step3.html#connecting-using-windows-and-putty
The best way to solve this may be a Skype/Screen share. I am out of 
office till tomorrow. You can get help sooner than that though. When you 
go to https://atmo.cyverse.org/ and login, you should see a round blue 
and white icon that floats over the lower-right of the page you can 
press for live help.


Let me know what works (or does not), thanks!

- Jason
