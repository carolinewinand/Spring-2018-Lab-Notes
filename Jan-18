A. What is Cyverse?
	1. Researched the company and what cyberinfrastructure is in 
general. 
	2. Began watching the December Webinar from Jason Williams
		a. BLOCK: lost wifi capabilities yet again in the 
library. 
		b. Completed the demo on the discovery environment 
application.
		c. Took notes on the entire webinar in my lab notebook.
B. Read through the Data Capentry Forum, nothing was particularly useful 
for my project. Nothing about my issue with the AWS system.
C. Found the ticket system for bug fixes, or improvement suggestions, 
called JIRA. You are suppose to log into JIRA with your Cyverse 
credentials, but mine were not working. I tried to find a solution to 
the problem on my own, but I did not have access to the JIRA wiki page. 
I chatted with Sriram on the help chat. I wrote:

"Hello Sriram, I am a student in Dr. Anne Stapleton's Lab at UNCW. I'm 
currently working on a project to began testing the Data Carpentry 
genomics lesson instructions, data and apps, with the goal of writing 
questions for Jason Williams and figuring out how to make ‘implanted 
known-truth specific bases’ as known-truth files that can be used for 
future lessons. I ran into an issue while moving through the Data 
Caprentry Genomic lessons, specifically in the "Introduction to the 
Command Line" lesson. I do not have access to the pre-imaged Amazon Web 
Services that are recommended in the Set Up instructions. So before I 
can continue on my project, I need to submit a ticket through the 
Cyverse JIRA tool, but my credentials are not working on the site, and I 
do not have access to the wiki link on the "Using the CyVerse Wiki and 
JIRA" website to find out why this isn't working. I know I am using the 
correct ID and password as well. If you could please help me trouble 
shoot this issue with JIRA, that would be most helpful. Thank you!"

and he reassigned me to Jason Williams. Striaght to the source I 
suppose.
