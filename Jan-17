From Dr. Stapleton in regards to the issue I encountered yesterday about the AWS system for the data carpentry 
lessons:


"How about logging into CyVerse (The DE, eg, which is the ‘desktop icon’ view of apps) and sending a help ticket 
asking this question?  It would be a good thing to have documented and it does not seem to be in the forum 
already."

I created a cyverse account. I need to determine what The data commons and the discovery environment portions 
of the site are.
